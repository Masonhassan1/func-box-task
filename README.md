I have created a react that allows user to register, login and upload their notes in the data base. To run this project please follow the steps
1. Download the code. 
2. Run command "npx create-react-app". 
3. Run the command "npm start" on the main folder. This will launch the react application.
4. Open the folder 'backend' on a separate tab and run "nodemon index.js" or "node index.js". This will allow the application to interact with the mongodb database.
